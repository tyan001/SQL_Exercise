# SQL_Exercise
Just a SQL Excercise to transform a relational schema to SQL statements.

The relational schema deals with a database where a teacher and student can keep track of Assignments. <br>

Example SQL statements added to do :
 * Created student and teacher account
 * Made a Course and added the students in it
 * Created Assignments for the teacher
 * Let the student submit homework
 * Show how would a teacher navigate to the course's assignment, the student's asssignments, the submissions and comments of the assignment
 * In the end the teacher grades the assignment and emails a comment to the student.
